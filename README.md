Processor SDK Documentation in Sphinx
=====================================

## Instructions to build the project on Ubuntu

### Clone the Git Repo

    $ git clone https://github.com/TexasInstruments/processor-sdk-doc.git

### Install tools on Ubuntu

Use the following command in a python virtual environment for a known working
config:

    $ cd processor-sdk-doc
    $ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

> [!WARNING]
> This is supported using Python v3.12+. If using an older Python version, some package versions in `requirements.txt` may not be compatible, possibly due to an older
> bundled `pip` version.

OR you can use a docker container like the following:
    - [psdk-doc-docker](https://github.com/TexasInstruments/processor-sdk-doc/pkgs/container/processor-sdk-doc)

### Build on Ubuntu

To build the documentation a DEVFAMILY and OS must be specified as either an
argument to `make` or set as environment variables prior to execution of `make`.

DEVFAMILY represents the Device Family. Possible values correspond to the names
of directories listed under `configs/`. For example:

 * "AM335X" (representing AM335X family)
 * "AM437X" (representing AM437X family)
 * "AM57X" (representing AM57X family)
 * "AM64X" (representing AM64X family)
 * "AM62X" (representing AM62X family)
 * "AM62AX" (representing AM62AX family)
 * "AM62PX" (representing AM62PX family)
 * "AM62LX" (representing AM62L family)
 * "AM62DX" (representing AM62D family)
 * "AM65X" (representing AM65X family)
 * "DRA821A" (representing DRA821A)
 * "J721E" (representing Jacinto 7 ES)
 * "J7200" (representing Jacinto 7 VCL)
 * "J721S2" (representing Jacinto 7 AEP)
 * "J784S4" (representing Jacinto 7 AHP)
 * "J722S" (representing Jacinto 7 AEN)
 * "GEN" (representing General family not listed above)
 * "CORESDK" (representing CORESDK)

OS represents the operating system. Possible values correspond to the second
parameter of files listed under the `configs/<DEVFAMILY>/` directory. For
example `AM57X_linux_toc.txt` means that `linux` is a valid OS value.

Example build commands:

 - Build linux documentation for AM335X

       $ make DEVFAMILY=AM335X OS=linux

 - Build android documentation for AM62X

       $ make DEVFAMILY=AM62X OS=android

 - Build debian documentation for AM62PX

       $ make DEVFAMILY=AM62PX OS=debian

 - Build EdgeAI documentation for AM62AX

       $ make DEVFAMILY=AM62AX OS=edgeai
